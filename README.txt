## Description
This Web Application project was modeled to be an online ordering web application which allows customer to place orders via online and get their orders by delivery to their door step or pick up at the store they preferred.


We have used ASP.NET Webforms to build the application, and have implemented additional features:
	1) reCAPTCHA
	2) Two-Factor Authentication
	3) Get Current Location
	4) AJAX-Based Searching
	5) Export Report to PDF
	6) Paypal Transaction Simulator Intergration
Details on each can be found in the report handed in alongside this README.

## Usage
	To try out the program, it is advised to start from the Home page (Home.aspx in the Home folder). The application will force you to the login page when you trying to access other page without logged in.

The login credentials for dummy accounts in each role are as follows:
	
				USERNAME		PASSWORD
	ADMIN: 			thamql2003		@aA1234567890
	CUSTOMER:		thamQiLUNN		123456789Tql@
